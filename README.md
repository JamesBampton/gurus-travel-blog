## Usage

A user can navigate and view blogs without registration. If user would like to create a blog or comment on a blog then the user must first register an account, then login. Once logged in the user has access to create a blog, delete their own blog and comments on all blogs. As well as delete their own comments.

---

## Future Developments

Add admin accounts to manage the application, blogs.
Allow users to delete all their own comments and not just the last comments they have entered.
Look to create a unique angle for the blog, for example focus on travellers with dogs or travellers on bikes only. At the moment the blog is very generic and it may be better narrowed down to a specific group of travellers.
